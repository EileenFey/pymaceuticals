The last scatter was briefly explained by Dwight in class because many of us had confusionn about what was meant by 'average observed tumor volume'.

I looked at this site
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html

I looked at this site
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522563/how-to-access-the-index-value-in-a-for-loop

to use the enumerate function so that I could isolate each drug regimen in the for loop rather than looking at the whole list of drugs.
